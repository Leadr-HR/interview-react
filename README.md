# Welcome to the Leadr FE Developer Tech Screen

## System Requirements
- an IDE that you can write frontend code in
- git installed (hopefully this is already done since you have this project in hand)
- yarn package manager [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Your Task Should You Choose To Accept It
In this tech screen you will be working on a simple CRUD application centered around meetings.
This is fairly open ended, we want to see how you approach a complex problem. You are by no means expected to finish wiring up the entire application.

While this is open ended and you can start with any piece that you would like, we recommend working on the project in this order:
1. Meeting List
2. Create Meeting Form
3. Updating the Meeting List after Create
4. Editing Meetings
5. Deleting Meetings

### What we have provided for you

1. A scaffolded client project - No need to waste time setting stuff up, we got your back here.
2. A local server with a couple basic api endpoints - We needed to provide data to you somehow!
3. /client/utils/fetch.js - this is an api utility to help with reaching the api we have set up for you.
4. A welcome page to help keep you on track. Its the default page that loads when you start the application and it is accessible from the navigation

## To Start Your Journey

Open two command line instances (terminal for Mac, cmd for Windows)
In the first instance you will want to run the following:
`cd server && yarn && yarn start`

In the second instance you will want to run:
`cd client && yarn && yarn dev`

### What does this do?
This will install the base depencencies and start both applications. The server application will run on port 5000 and the client application on port 3000.
When the client app starts up it will open a tab in your default browser showing the app running on port 3000
